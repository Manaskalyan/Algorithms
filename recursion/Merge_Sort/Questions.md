# Merge Sort Questions

1) Power of Computation : It is able to sort 100 arrays of length 500 in seconds time.
                          No human being can do this feat. Imagine if Srinivasa Ramanujan has computing resources like this.
						  Very difficult to not fall in love with this problem solving.
						  


2) Number of times Merge sort is called for an array?? Use a global variable and increment it every time you call it.
   Can I guess or solve it theoritically??

3) I used to have difficulty in understanding / implementing recursion pronblems. The problem is not with understanding recursive problems but with 
   not understanding implementation / how function calls work roperly.
   
   Always think of finding number of people in a line before you problem.

4) Here I have used a global array with fixed length. How do I change it to dynamic Length array??
